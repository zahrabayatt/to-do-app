# To Do App

This is a simple and interactive to-do app built with **Vite** and **React**. The app allows users to create tasks, organize them into categories, and manage their status. You can mark tasks as **done**, set them as **important**, and also edit or delete them. Categories can also be created, edited, or removed to further organize tasks.

Additionally, the app includes a **dark mode** and **light mode** toggle, and all user data (tasks, categories, and theme preference) is stored in **localStorage**, ensuring persistence between sessions.
